Dr. Li works on metabolomics, bioinformatics and systems biology, and combines such methodological and computational developments with important biomedical questions, especially in human immunology. Through large scale data integration and network modeling, Dr. Li helped define important transcriptomic programs for vaccine induced antibody response. Such work represents a first step to bring omics data into quantitative modeling of human immune response. Metabolomics data from high resolution mass spectrometry provide detailed chemical information resulted from gene activities, environmental exposure, pathobiology, host-pathogen interaction and pharmacological interventions. The effective mining of metabolomics data thus presents fascinating possibilities to understand and monitor health and diseases. Dr. Li has brought genome-scale metabolic models into the field of high throughput metabolomics, and developed cutting-edge algorithms for analyzing metabolomic data. These works have demonstrated great potential to produce mechanistic insights. Continued research in these fronts, and synergy between them, will contribute to quantitative models of immunity and to systems medicine.
